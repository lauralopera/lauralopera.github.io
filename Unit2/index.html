	<h1> Visial Design Elements. by Laura Lopera. </h1>
	<strong><h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2></strong>
	<p>
		<ul>
          <li><a href="http://agigen.se" target="_blank"> Agigen Creative Web Agency.</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://mariusz.cc/index.values.html?utm_expid=70299007-5.r95_xbLsTxughGiAj88bvQ.1</li" target="_blanck"> Mariusz Ciesla, Coding Designer.</a></ul>
	</P>	

	<strong><h2>Why they exhibit effective use of space, size and balance?</h2></strong>
	<p>
		They both have a effective use of <strong>space</strong> because there is a good proportion between the elements that are part of the focal point and hierarchy. There is a interesting flow when you are using them.

		<strong>Sizes</strong> of objects are clear to point where the designer wants the user to focus. In both of them the focus point is very similar: a message of what they do and the background image. 

		The sites are as well <strong>balanced</strong> as the visual arrangement is very organised and logical order.
	</p>

	<strong><h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2></strong>
	<p>
		They are VERY similar. They have alike design, graphics, arrangements and use of the space.
		Agigen (which is and agency) is more complex, it has more content and it is more elaborated, it has also an extended menu and some animation. Mariusz (who is a freelancer) is specific and the rest of the website is very visual.
